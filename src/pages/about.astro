  <h2 class="text-2xl">What is mioi?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>mioi</strong> is my personal website. It's a place where I can share my thoughts and projects in my career in software. I may also showcase my various hobbies at mioi as well. <strong>mioi</strong> can be a word or an acronym. I think of it to mean <i>miscellaneous items of interest</i> as a catch-all for the reasons you may be visiting the website.

    My name is Tom van Dinther and I work professionally in software. This is a picture of me at the top of a hill in New Zealand where I used to live, but I now live and work in The Netherlands.

  <h2 class="text-2xl">What am I currently working on and learning?</h2>
  <p>
    In my profressional day-to-day I work as a consultant, practising DevOps and platform engineering. This involves a lot of bash and YAML. So, to fill my thirst for programming I like to get stuck into Haskell, creating DevOps tools, and the continued development of this website.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I am also a part of the communities for the CUE and KCL configuration languages. I think that these are an exciting development in the world of platform engineering and you will see plenty of content on my blog about these.

  <h2 class="text-2xl">Who do I follow in the tech-sphere?</h2>
  <p>
    I have a few favourite YouTube channels and blogs that I follow. I highly recommend each one of them for the topics they cover.
  </p>
  <br/>

  <h3 class="text-xl">Viktor Farcic (DevOps Toolkit)</h3>
  <Button link="https://www.youtube.com/c/DevOpsToolkit">YouTube</Button>
  <p>
    Every week Viktor releases a new video to his YouTube channel to bring us a new idea, technology, or perspective to the world of DevOps and platform engineering. If you only have 30 minutes per week to stay up-to-date on this space, there is no better resource.

  <h3 class="text-xl">Mark Seemann</h3>
  <Button link="https://blog.ploeh.dk/">Blog</Button>
  <p>
    Mark Seemann is an experienced software consultant. He is a favourite of mine because his teachings are a great intersection of C# and functional programming. There are plenty of pearls of wisdom in his blog and talks he has given which can be found on YouTube.
  </p>
  <br/>
  
  <h3 class="text-xl">Scott Wlaschin</h3>
  <Button link="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/">Blog</Button>
  <p>
    Scott is a software consultant and massive proponent for F#. His blog posts and talks on the topic of functional programming and domain design are invaluable. Even if you don't use F# or functional programming, the learnings from his blog and talks will take your software design to the next level.
