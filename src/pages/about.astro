  <h2 class="text-2xl">What is mioi?</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>mioi</strong> is my personal website. It's a place where I can share my thoughts and projects in my career in software. I may also showcase my various hobbies at mioi as well. <strong>mioi</strong> can be a word or an acronym. I think of it to mean <i>miscellaneous items of interest</i> as a catch-all for the reasons you may be visiting the website.

  <h2 class="text-2xl">Who am I?</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Tom van Dinther and I work professionally in software. This is a picture of me at the top of a hill in New Zealand where I currently live and work.

  <h2 class="text-2xl">What am I currently working on and learning?</h2>
  <p>
    In my profressional day-to-day I work with Kubernetes clusters, practising platform engineering for internal customers. This involves a lot of bash and YAML. So, to fill my thirst for programming I like to get stuck into Haskell and the continued development of this website. My next area of interest is in mobile app-development using React-Native.

  <h2 class="text-2xl">Who do I follow in the tech-sphere?</h2>
  <p>
    I have a few favourite YouTube channels and blogs that I follow. I highly recommend each one of them for the topics they cover.

  <p>
    If you write ASP.NET Core applications in C#, then you should definitely subscribe to Nick's channel.

  <h3 class="text-xl">Theo Browne</h3>
  <Button link="https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg">YouTube</Button>
  <p>
    Theo's YouTube channel is the place for all things full-stack (especially in the React eco-system). He is extremely opinionated, so it's a good thing his opinions are well thought out and backed up by his experience. He is also a great communicator and his videos are always entertaining.

  <h3 class="text-xl">Mark Seemann</h3>
  <Button link="https://blog.ploeh.dk/">Blog</Button>
  <p>
    Mark Seemann is an experienced software consultant. He is a favourite of mine because his teachings are a great intersection of C# and functional programming. There are plenty of pearls of wisdom in his blog and talks he has given which can be found on YouTube.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <h3 class="text-xl">Scott Wlaschin</h3>
  <Button link="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/">Blog</Button>
  <p>
    Scott is a software consultant and massive proponent for F#. His blog posts and talks on the topic of functional programming and domain design are invaluable. Even if you don't use F# or functional programming, the learnings from his blog and talks will take your software design to the next level.
