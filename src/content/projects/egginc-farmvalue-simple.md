In early 2018, I had an idea for a web-based calculator for a mobile game I was playing at the time called **Egg, Inc.**. Around this time I was just starting my university degree and completing my first year of business papers. I had no knowledge of building websites, so this project was a great drive to learn more about web development. I stuck to the simple trifecta of vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
