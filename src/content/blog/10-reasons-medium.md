Medium is a widely-used platform for self-publishing articles online, attracting writers and readers from various fields including technology, wellness, and more. Initially appreciated for its clean look and community of professionals, it has become a hotspot for sharing knowledge and insights. However, when it comes to sourcing reliable technical content, I find that it falls short in several ways. In this article, I will outline 10 reasons why I exclude Medium from my search results when looking for technical articles.

## 1. It has a ~~like~~ clap button
In the world of technical discourse, accuracy and depth should trump popularity. Yet, Medium's clap button encourages a type of popularity contest that can often overshadow quality and correctness. Unfortunately, this button serves merely as a barometer for an article's popularity, not its value.

The absence of a dislike button further compounds this issue, removing an essential channel for dissent and balanced feedback. This single-sided engagement metric can inadvertently foster a culture where writers chase popularity over substance, diluting the overall quality of technical content available on the platform. This worrying trend is further amplified when we consider the next point.

## 2. It has a partner program
Medium's partner program stands as a central pillar in encouraging writers to contribute to the platform. At first glance, it appears as a positive initiative, rewarding content creators for their effort and engagement. However, it has a significant drawback when it comes to the dissemination of technical content.

The program, by tying financial rewards to reads and interactions, inadvertently incentivises increases in quantity over quality. For the technical sphere, this means a proliferation of articles of dubious nature, designed to attract engagement. This sets a precarious stage where sensationalism triumphs over substance, pollluting the field of technical articles with potentially misleading information.

## 3. It is ad-free
At first glance, Mediumâ€™s ad-free platform appears like a sanctuary for readers tired of the relentless ad bombardments on
